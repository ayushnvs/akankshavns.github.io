        <p>
            <b>Akanksha institute of prayagraj</b>has always occupied an esteemed place among the Universities of India for over a century. Established on 23rd September 1887, it is the fourth oldest University of India after Calcutta, Bombay and Madras University. The credit for conceiving a large Central College in Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj), eventually to develop into a University, goes to Sir William Muir, Lt. Governor of United Provinces. As a result of his initiative the foundation stone of the Muir Central College (named after him) was laid on Dec. 9 1873 by His Excellency Lord Northbrook. Sir William Muir said on the occasion; "The establishment of a central college at Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj) has been my earnest desire ever since I assumed my present office." Shortly after coming here I found that a strong wish prevailed among the chief people of the place for a better means of education at Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj); and being myself deeply impressed with the same conviction, I took occasion at the first Darbar which I held here to urge upon those present the necessity of showing that they were sincere and in earnest, by contributing to the work.
